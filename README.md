Oxanium
=======

Oxanium is a square, futuristic font family. It feels at home on the
head-up display of a spaceship, or the scoreboard of a video game.
Its intuitive strokes ensure legibility at small sizes and quick
glances, while angled cuts add charisma to big headlines.

Oxanium is released under the SIL Open Font License.
